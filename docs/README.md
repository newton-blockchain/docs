## How TON works

TON is blockchain of blockchains with a masterchain to rule them all.

You can learn more about general architecture in [Basic Concepts](/overviews/TON_blockchain_overview.md) section.

## Getting started

Learn more on how to build with TON.

[Smart contracts entrypoint](/smart-contracts/).

[Standard smart contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/smartcont) is the best way to study how FunC works.

[API & SDK](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/docs/tree/master/docs/apis).

## Whitepapers

[Whitepapers overview](/docs) provide more details on the original vision Dr. Nikolai Durov had when he developed the concept.

## Infrastructure

TON can't work without payments, testnet and nodes required to be the backbone for functioning blockchain.
